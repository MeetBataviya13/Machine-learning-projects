    "- Creating target variables for classification and regression\n",

    "- Preparing final datasets for model training\n",

    "\n",
    "This project addresses two predictive tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hit / Flop Classification**\n",
    "   - A movie is classified as a *Hit* if its Return on Investment (ROI)\n",
    "     exceeds 100%, otherwise as a *Flop*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **IMDb Rating Prediction**\n",
    "   - Predicting audience ratings (`vote_average`) on a 0–10 scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering in this phase is designed to support both tasks\n",
    "while maintaining interpretability and deployment readiness.\n"
