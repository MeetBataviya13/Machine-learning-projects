    "## Objective\n",
    "In this notebook, we:\n",
    "- Aggregate transaction data at the customer level  \n",
    "- Create behavioral, recency, frequency, and trend-based features  \n",
    "- Construct the modeling dataset  \n",
    "- Define the target variable: future 12-month customer lifetime value (CLV)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: No ML modeling is performed here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering transforms raw transactional logs into structured behavioral indicators.  \n",
    "These features capture purchasing patterns, engagement levels, and trends that help predict future customer value.\n"
